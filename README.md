Betfair Bot For running a horse racing lay odds on favourite strategy.
This bot was developed to run with the old BetFair Soap API which has since been replaced by BetFair with a JSON API.
The interface to Betfair is done through an abstraction layer so replacing the SOAP API interface with a JSON API interface can be done without affecting the rest of the functionality.
